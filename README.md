## Functionality ⚙️
The JavaScript code in the assets/js/script.js file handles the functionality of the digital watch. It selects the HTML elements using their IDs and updates the time every second. The updateClock function retrieves the current time and formats it with leading zeros for single-digit values. The time is then displayed in the corresponding HTML elements.

# Learnings 🎯

I deepened my knowledge in manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model), using selectors to access and modify HTML elements.
I learned how to use JavaScript's Date object to obtain current date and time information.
I understood the importance of dividing code into functions, facilitating reuse and maintenance.
I learned how to use the setInterval function to dynamically update the clock every second.
