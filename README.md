# Technologies used 📚
HTML<br>

JavaScript<br>

## Functionality ⚙️
The JavaScript code in the assets/js/script.js file handles the functionality of the digital watch. It selects the HTML elements using their IDs and updates the time every second. The updateClock function retrieves the current time and formats it with leading zeros for single-digit values. The time is then displayed in the corresponding HTML elements.
